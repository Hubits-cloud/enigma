Path is key, plugboard, 3 of 5 rotors, plugboard, light.

On a rotor is listed 01-26 for all leters.
01 is 'a' 02 is 'b' exc.
On one rotor 01 representing keystrok 'a' may exit as 'f', in another rotor it may exit as 't'.
Each rotor encrypts in a different algoritm.
At the end is reflector, it has letters as pairs. So if letter comes in as 'z', it may exit as 'h' and vise verca.
After going through reflector it goes back out rotors
So it changes 7 times.
Each rotor can be changed to 26 different positions.

Plugboard swaps 2 letters.
So if 'U' and 'C' is connected than they swap. So if user presses 'C', 'U' will be sent to rotors.
